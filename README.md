# Friday Night Funkin' - Psike Engine
Psych Engine Fork that included bugfixes, minor QOL features, and performance to make the game runs better, such as
```
Hardware Caching (uses GPU to store images)
Streaming Musics (simultaneously load music data while its playing)
Tweaked Gameplay (you can revert some of the fixes, features in the options gameplay category)
Proper Gamepad Support (not tested, if there any issues, please open up in the repo asap!)
Reworked Menus (only some of it yet)
Lag Latency Fixes
Audio Backend Fixes
Garbage Collector/Memory Handling Fixes
Cleaner formatting on FPS Counter

and etc...
```


## Fork Installation:
You must have the newest haxe version above 4.1.5, and raltyro haxelib forks of hxCodec and linc_luajit

And you can also install raltyro forks of lime, and openfl if you want to

Just incase if your too lazy, you can run update.bat to automatically install the needed haxelibs to compile
